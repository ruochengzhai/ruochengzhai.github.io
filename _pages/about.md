I am a graduate student at the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on the simulation of Kilonova events, which are electromagnetic signals of neutron star mergers. 

I completed my B.S. degree at the Department of Physics, Tsinghua University.
